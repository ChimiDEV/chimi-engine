# Write your own Game Engine

... Is not an easy task (at least stated by many websites on the internet).
With this repository I want to undertake different mini-projects.
Those projects are in any way related to game engine development.
For Example I'll try to implement an Math Engine in any low-level language I can think of.
First approach will be C++ as I do have most knowledge in this language.
